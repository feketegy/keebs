# Keychron Q60 Modding Log

Decided to strip the paint from the case and polish the aluminium to a mirror shine.

## 1. Stripping

First, I tried oven cleaner to strip off the anodized layer from the aluminium with no luck, then I tried caustic soda starting with a low concentration then increasing it little by little. This didn't stripped away anything, so I started to suspect that the case is not anodized and the factory used some other process.

**BTW, if you're reading this, caustic soda is really nasty toxic stuff, make sure you know what you're doing if you want to try this at home.**

I got in contact with Keychron to see what process they used (I love Discord for this). It turns out lighter colors cannot be recreated with an anodization process, so they used simple powder coating on the aluminium.

Finally, knowing what process was used, I can strip it away with a simple paint stripper that works for powder coating too. Covered everything with the stripper and waited a couple of hours and it came of easily.

I don't know what those rubber feet thingies are made of but I litterally had to pry it off, not even the caustic soda could get it off from there...

Here's the final result of the paint strip, it's not perfect, but sanding to a smooth finish will remove the remaining bits and pieces of the paint. I have to say the stripped aluminium case looks really high quality, having a nice smooth layer, but it will need sanding for that mirror finish.

## 2. Sanding

Stripping away the paint then using some WD-40 to clean the surface, it revealed the CNC machining marks on it, so I have to sand it starting from lower grit. Starting from 320 grit going upwards.

Second pass on 800 grit sandpaper still has a lot of marks.

Also, the inside of the board looks horrible, but I will clean it then won't bother sanding it all the way through 3500 - 4000 as this part won't be seen at all. The image below shows the aftermath of the paint stripper too. It will need a lot of cleaning.

## 3. Polishing

As I'm not very experienced with sanding aluminium, as it is very soft, I started polishing before all the scratch marks were sanded out, and the first and second pass of polish revealed it. Albeit, it is very fine and not that visible, but I will either have to live with it or sand it all the way down again and start over...

First pass of polish.

Second pass of polish.

## 4. Re-polishing

The interior of the case needed a lot of work as there were sut erevywhere, I decided to sand the case all the way back and re-polish it again.

The light doesn't do justice to the metal, even though I didn't got to mirror shine the whole metal, I achieved somewhat a mirror polish. It's between a mirror shine and a matte polished look, which I like better as the fingerprints on the case is not that visible.

For the polishing paste I used one of the best polishers money could buy, it's the Mother's Mag & Aluminium Polish.

## 5. Modding

### 5.1. Tape Mod

Afraid that the bare metal interior would short out the PCB I added a layer of masking tape to it, dapening the sound a little, but it won't matter, read below :)

### 5.2. Switches

I decided if it's a metal case and then it should also sound metal :) so I threw out the Cherry MX Clears and put in Kailh Box Jades.

### 5.3. Keycaps

I wanted a pastel looking color for this case, but to be honest all colors will look good with polished metal. I bought Novelkeys_ Sands keycaps, which is a cherry profile set.

In the future, maybe I will change it, I also kinda want to see how it would look like with a more stronger color, like a PBT Cherry Copper or even a GMK Copper.
