# Keychron Q60 Modding Log

Decided to strip the paint from the case and polish the aluminium to a mirror shine.

## 1. Stripping

First, I tried oven cleaner to strip off the anodized layer from the aluminium with no luck, then I tried caustic soda starting with a low concentration then increasing it little by little. This didn't stripped away anything, so I started to suspect that the case is not anodized and the factory used some other process.

**BTW, if you're reading this, caustic soda is really nasty toxic stuff, make sure you know what you're doing if you want to try this at home.**

I got in contact with Keychron to see what process they used (I love Discord for this). It turns out lighter colors cannot be recreated with an anodization process, so they used simple powder coating on the aluminium.

Finally, knowing what process was used, I can strip it away with a simple paint stripper that works for powder coating too. Covered everything with the stripper and waited a couple of hours and it came of easily.

I don't know what those rubber feet thingies are made of but I litterally had to pry it off, not even the caustic soda could get it off from there...

Here's the final result of the paint strip, it's not perfect, but sanding to a smooth finish will remove the remaining bits and pieces of the paint. I have to say the stripped aluminium case looks really high quality, having a nice smooth layer, but it will need sanding for that mirror finish.
