## Intro

_I'd like to start this review by saying that this board is not for everybody especially if you are used to 65%+ layouts. I will mainly focus on the features of the board and not on the layout._

My reasoning for buying this keyboard is that I like my super customizable keyboards but I also like boards that are well constructed and I don't have to spend hours mapping the keys and customizing them to my needs.

## Packaging

I like the minimal packaging that the board comes in.

It includes a USB-C to USB-C cable, four pointing stick caps (for some reason), and four AA batteries. What is missing though are keycap and switch pullers (it only comes by buying and extra keycap set).

Upon unboxing I was a little surprised by the weight of the keyboard without the AA batteries, it was heavier than I thought, and also on the size of the case, I thought that with the mouse buttons, it would be much larger but it's not.

## Pointing Stick (Trackpoint)

So PFU calls it a pointing stick, everybody else calls it a trackpoint though. I will be using the two terms interchangeably.

It's cool and I always liked this feature on my old Lenovo ThinkPad laptop, it's a trip down memory lane that's for sure.

I get what they are trying to achieve with it by including it in the keyboard. Simplicity to the max, not needing any other input devices. 
This feature is also good if you travel with the board not needing to pack an extra mouse in the bag.

The stick's sensitivity can be adjusted, it has four levels of sensitivity and I use mine on the first level as this is also super sensitive to me.

I can see myself using the trackpoint more, but having Logitech MX Master 3 that's just too performant that this trackpoint, or any trackpoint for that matter, could replace any time soon.

## Keycaps

Let's address the elephant in the room... The G, H, and B keycaps are irregularly shaped because of the pointing stick, so putting another keycap set on this thing will be almost impossible.

Also, the space bar has different mounting points than on any other keycap set, so that is another huge _negative_ if you want to customize this thing.

Another minus that is not addressed in other reviews has to do with typing and the pointing stick around the G, H, and B keys, pressing down on these keys can be sometimes cumbersome because of the stick and accidentally pressing that. I get why they opted not to add clicking on the track stick.

This keycap set is just that, a nice-looking custom set that nobody will change because there aren't any compatible sets. PFU promised to release the 3D models for the G, H, and B keys so other manufacturers could create sets, but I can't see GMK, for example, creating extras for this because HHKB is super niche as it is. Basically, the manufacturer probably has to create custom molds for these three keys just to be used on the HHKB Studio, nah, I don't see this happening.

## Switches

No Topre unfortunately, that is the main attraction when considering buying an HHKB. PFU doesn't think so, by ditching Topre and using MX style switches on this PCB that can be hot-swapped. Ditching Topre at least for now, maybe in the future they will come out with another studio model with Topres.

PFU's PR response for ditching Topre is that users want silent switches to "immerse" themselves in whatever task they are doing which is total BS in my opinion. I hope that in the future we will see the Studio with Topres.

It just makes one think, that HHKB is all about simplicity and an all-around input device, hence the mouse buttons, the pointing stick, the limited keycaps, and the gesture pads... so why would they think users buying this board would want to disassemble it and use other switches?

Don't get me wrong, it's a nice addition nonetheless and PFU clearly stated that the Studio is NOT the continuation of the Professional product line, but it's a separate product line altogether and they will support and develop both.

The MX switches that come with the Studio are Kailh 45g linear box switches, and to be honest they feel like tactile ones and close to broken in Topres. Box-style switches are usually stiffer than regular MX stems and yes, they are somewhat silent but I will be switching them out with clicky ones (yeah, I know I'm a different animal LOL).

The mouse button switches are hot-swappable too, which is a surprise to me. They are using some kind of low-profile MX switches there most likely from Kailh.

## Gesture Pads

This is a cool addition to the keyboard in my opinion. I got used to it from the start and I can see myself using it more and more in various applications. Too bad that I can't map the pads on a per-application basis like the Logitech MX Master 3 mouse for example. This is purely a software decision and I hope they will update it in the future.

Also, the pads are not like a traditional trackpad, it's much less sensitive, and I can't figure out if it's because of the software or not, it lags a little before triggering the gesture. I'm guessing it's because it's very easy to accidentally trigger the pads with your palms and the software has to decide whether it's a genuine gesture or an accidental one.

Like the trackpoint, the gesture pads sensitivity can be adjusted too, but that initial lag still remains.

Nonetheless, I will be using the pads and more likely customizing it on the layers to be able to use it with different applications.

## Keymap Tool

The Studio can be used with the [HHKB Keymap Tool](https://happyhackingkb.com/download/#tools) which is a custom tool developed specifically for the HHKB Studio. I can see the points why this decision was made instead of using QMK/VIA/Vial. It's easier to use and more streamlined than VIA for example. 

The keymap tool can only be used in wired mode, that's mainly because of Bluetooth and chip compatibility issues but it's not a good look for the HHKB Studio if you're preaching quality and making a custom mapping tool.

The tool is straightforward to use if you're used to other similar tools like VIA or Vial. It has four profiles, each profile having four layers triggered by various Fn keys.

## Conclusion

It seems that PFU tries to keep up with the times catering to the mechanical keyboard market, which is a good thing, but it gets confused in the process. They stated that the Studio is for keyboard enthusiasts who can customize the board but not really. Yes, you can swap out the switches but that's about it. No keycap set will fit because of the G, H, and B keys and because of the space bar mounting points. Also, you can't swap out the stabilizers either. 

The construction of the board is really good, they don't let me down there. Its design is subjective so I won't review that, but I like it :) It's smaller than I expected.

With all the negative aspects regarding the keycaps, still, for people like me, who like high-quality keyboards, and don't need nor want much customization, the Studio is a good choice.
